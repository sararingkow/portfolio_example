        <h3 class="font-bold text-grey-500">My journey</h3>
        <p class="mt-4 text-grey-600">
          Growing up in the <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">northern suburbs of Zealand</span>, I discovered my love for creativity early on.
          From drawing to small projects, I always came up with something to do. This passion for creativity, however.. deep down, I always knew that
          I wanted to
          <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">make it a career</span>&mdash; something I could do for a living. But that, combined with my newfound
          interest in <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">technology</span>, made me doubtful. I had no idea of what you could become, with those two
          things. <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">Animator</span> was an option. That was the first thing I considered. But after seeing how hard
          it was to get the proper education for that, I had to try and find something else. After having taken a lot of detours, in the form of high-school
          and singular courses, I eventually found my way to
          <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">multimedia-design</span> through an open-house event. The moment I heard about it, I knew I had to give
          it a try. It combined the best of both worlds&mdash; creativity and technology. And that was enough for me to apply.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-grey-600">
          After starting my studies, I quickly realised the importance of <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">accessibility</span> in digital design,
          both for myself and others. It became clear that creating <span class="highlight-text text-red-500 font-bold">inclusive experiences</span> was
          not just about meeting technical standards, but about making meaningful connections for everyone, regardless of their abilities.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-grey-600">
          This understanding sparked a deeper <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">drive within me to focus on accessibility</span> as a core-principle
          in my work. As I continue to grow in the few months that I have left of my studies, Iâ€™m determined to design digital platforms that <span
            class="text-red-500 font-bold">remove barriers</span
          > and ensure a more inclusive experience for all.

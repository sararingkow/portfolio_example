        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-7">
          As a multimedia-designer, I specialize in UX and web design, with a strong focus on accessibility and inclusive design. I have a deep
          understanding of the meaning of design, its impact on usability, and the overall importance of creating visually engaging and user-friendly
          interfaces. As someone who's late-diagnosed with autism, I know what it's like to be a person who's not fully capable of certain things and
          have limited understanding of the world around them. This has led me to my main goal&mdash; to create digital experiences that are
          accessible and inclusive for all users, regardless of their disabilities.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-7">
          Creativity is at the heart of everything I do, driving me to explore the world of design with enthusiasm and curiosity. Each project
          presents a chance to transform ideas into meaningful experiences that connect with others. I thrive on the excitement of experimenting with
          new techniques and discovering innovative ways to bring concepts to life. As I journey through this ever-evolving field, I look forward to
          embracing new challenges and forging connections that inspire growth and creativity. The future holds endless possibilities, and I'm eager
          to see where this path will lead me.

      I have worked on a lot of different projects in the past, each different in its own way. However, some of them are not as important as others.
      When taking this sort of course, you're bound to have both favorite and least favorite projects. Because you can't always decide what kind of
      project you have to do. I've decided to highlight some of the projects that I'm most proud of.

                  This project was my very first project, created as part of the entrance-exam to the multimedia-design course. It's a site that
                  revolves around computers. We had to make this to show what we had learned during first three weeks of the course.

                  This was our first real project after the entrance-exam. Here, we had to create a site that revolved around a topic of our own

                  wikipedia-site. Though it's not the prettiest, it was still a fun project, which is why I have included it here.

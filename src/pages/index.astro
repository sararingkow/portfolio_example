                      This was the exam-project on 3rd semester. Here, we had to design a website based off of the subject 'subcriptions'. We had the
                      option to either go with an existing site or go with our own concept. We chose the second option, and came up with a business
                      called <em>Vinens Essens</em>&mdash; a wine company that sells different wine-boxes on a monthly subcription.

                      This was the first project that I did during my internship on 4th semester at the advertising-agency <em>Kadaver</em>. Here, I
                      had to come up with a redesign for Kadaver's current website. The site hadn't been updated in 5 years, so I had to make it look
                      modern and up-to-date. It was also originally done in Squarespace, so translating that into code was very interesting.

                      This was the exam-project on 3rd semester. Here, we had to design a website based off of the subject 'subcriptions'. We had the
                      option to either go with an existing site or go with our own concept. We chose the second option, and came up with a business
                      called <em>Vinens Essens</em>&mdash; a wine company that sells different wine-boxes on a monthly subcription.

                      This was the first project that I did during my internship on 4th semester at the advertising-agency <em>Kadaver</em>. Here, I
                      had to come up with a redesign for Kadaver's current website. The site hadn't been updated in 5 years, so I had to make it look
                      modern and up-to-date. It was also originally done in Squarespace, so translating that into code was very interesting.

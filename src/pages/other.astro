      In addition to my Highlighted cases, there was also the projects that I was least proud of. It's everything from unfinished projects to projects
      that I just don't like. Here are the current ones.

        description="This project was the third project on 1st semester. Here, we had to make a game from scratch using JavaScript and CSS. Things were looking good, until it didn't. I messed up big time on the coding-part, which resulted in the game not working at all. I also didn't manage to make a proper landing-page for it, because making the game itself took me a lot of time."

        description="This project was the fourth project on 1st semester. Here, we had to go out and film an interview of a person with a certain passion, and then make a site for it. Although I am proud of the video-product itself, I'm not so proud of the site that I made for it. I feel like I could've done so much more with it, but I just think it's so messy and hastily done."

        description="This project was the first case-project on 2nd semester. Here, we had to make a website— subsequent to the original —for an organisation called Vild Mad. If I hadn't ended up in a group with a bad work-dynamic, I think this project would've turned out great. We just couldn't make things work, and we were really falling behind— partly because of one group-member."

        description="This project was the first case-project on 3rd semester. Here, we had to make a Danish pendant to a campaign called Digital Cleanup Day. In the beginning, I really liked where we were going with this project. But, I just didn't like the way it ended up turning out. It didn't work as well as I had hoped, and I just think it just looks messy, unprofessional and unfinished."

      In addition to my highlighted projects, there was also the projects that I was least proud of. It's everything from unfinished projects to
      projects that I just don't like. Here are the current ones.

          <p class="text-gray-300 mt-2 leading-7">
            This project was the third project on 1st semester. Here, we had to make a game from scratch using JavaScript and CSS. Things were looking
            good, until it didn't. I messed up big time on the coding-part, which resulted in the game not working at all. I also didn't manage to
            make a proper landing-page for it, because making the game itself took me a lot of time.

      <!-- Project 2 -->
      <a href="https://sararingkow.github.io/videosite_v3/" target="_blank" aria-label="View project: Video-site (1st semester)">

          <p class="text-gray-300 mt-2 leading-7">
            This project was the fourth project on 1st semester. Here, we had to go out and film an interview of a person with a certain passion, and
            then make a site for it. Although I am proud of the video-product itself, I'm not so proud of the site that I made for it. I feel like I
            could've done so much more with it to capture the essence of the person we had interviewed, but I just think it's so messy and hastily
            done.

          <p class="text-gray-300 mt-2 leading-7">
            This project was the first case-project on 2nd semester. Here, we had to make a website&mdash; subsequent to the original &mdash;for an
            organisation called <em>Vild Mad</em>. If I hadn't ended up in a group with a bad work-dynamic, I think this project would've turned out
            great. We just couldn't make things work, and we were really falling behind&mdash; partly because of one group-member.

          <p class="text-gray-300 mt-2 leading-7">
            This project was the first case-project on 3rd semester. Here, we had to make a Danish pendant to a campaign called <em
              >Digital Cleanup Day</em
            >. In the beginning, I really liked where we were going with this project. But, I just didn't like the way it ended up turning out. It
            didn't work as well as I had hoped, and I just think it just looks messy, unprofessional and unfinished.

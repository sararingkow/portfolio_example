I messed up on the coding-part, which resulted in the game not working at all. I also didn't manage to make a proper landing-page for it."

        description="This was the fourth project on 1st semester. Here, we had to go out and film an interview of a person with a certain passion, and then make a site for it. Although I am proud of the video-product itself, I'm not so proud of the site that I made for it. I feel like I could've done much more with it, but I just think it's messy and hastily done."

If I hadn't ended up in a group with a bad work-dynamic, I think this project would've turned out great. We just couldn't make things work."

In the beginning, I really liked where we were going with this project. But, I just didn't like the way it ended up turning out. It didn't work as well as I had hoped, and I just think it just looks messy, unprofessional and unfinished."
